# travel-map
This is a leisure project to visualize places that I have travelled, using d3.js

Demo in [oscartcy.github.io/travel-map/](oscartcy.github.io/travel-map/)

## Roadmap
- [x] Interactive rotatable globe
- [x] Shows travelled cities, coordinates are dynamically queried from third party service using the city name.
- [ ] More information on cities and each trip
- [ ] Draw arcs to show the travel route
- [ ] Interactive way to selectively shows travel routes on globe
- [ ] [Extra] Switch between orthographic and mercator projection

## Inspiration
